## ‚öôÔ∏è Get Started

You can use this library by downloading the `wt-lightbox.js` and `wt-lightbox.css` files from this repository and including them in your project.

### 1. Add the CSS

Include the `wt-lightbox.css` stylesheet inside your HTML's `<head>` tag.

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/wt-lightbox.css">
</head>
```

### 2. Add the JavaScript

Place the `wt-lightbox.js` script file just before your closing `</body>` tag for optimal performance.

```html
<body>
  <script src="path/to/wt-lightbox.js"></script>
</body>
```

### 3. Markup HTML Structure

This script works by detecting two simple classes.
1. Add the class="wt-lightbox-group" to the main container that holds your gallery.
2. Add the class="wt-lightbox-item" to each individual element that contains a thumbnail.
The script will automatically find the `<img>` tag inside each item and use its src, alt, and title attributes to build the lightbox.

```html
<div class="wt-lightbox-group example-thumbs-layout">
    <div class="wt-lightbox-item">
        <img src="images/caretta.jpg" alt="Caretta caretta, oil painting by alex tade" title="Caretta caretta" />
    </div>
    <div class="wt-lightbox-item">
        <img src="images/clouds.jpg" alt="Clouds, oil painting by alex tade" title="Clouds" />
    </div>
    <div class="wt-lightbox-item">
        <img src="images/roots.jpg" alt="Roots, oil painting by alex tade" title="Roots" />
    </div>
    <div class="wt-lightbox-item">
        <img src="images/unicorn.jpg" alt="Unicorn, oil painting by alex tade" title="Unicorn" />
    </div>
</div>
```

That's all there is to it! The script will automatically find these items and build the lightbox gallery.
